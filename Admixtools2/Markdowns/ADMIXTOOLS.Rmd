## RUNNING ADMIXTOOLS
Admixtools is a software package for the analysis of population structure and admixture. This folder contains scripts to run QpGraph in Admixtools2, which is an R friendly version of the original Admixtools. Note that this is still different from admixr, which is another R-adapted admixtools package (although results will be practically the same).The documentation for Admixtools2 can be found [here](https://uqrmaie1.github.io/admixtools/articles/admixtools.html)

To run QpGraph, follow the scripts under Admixtools2/Scripts.
Scripts were modified from https://github.com/popgenDK/seqAfrica_wildebeest/tree/main/qpGraph.
